# AI & Data Usage Policy

## 1. Intent
This project is licensed under the **MIT License**. We chose this to ensure that human developers can build, innovate, and commercialize their work without friction. We believe in open tools for human creators.

## 2. Machine Learning & Training (Non-Consent)
The permissions granted under the MIT License are intended for software development, distribution, and execution. These permissions **are not intended** to extend to the use of this repository—including its logic, architecture, and protocol definitions, as a training dataset for commercial generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), or similar machine learning systems.

**Pursuant to Article 4(3) of the EU Copyright Directive (2019/790), the author explicitly reserves all rights for text and data mining.**

## 3. Why This Matters for our software
Our software relies on specific, human-architected logic for concurrency and reliability. 
- **Attribution:** Current AI models often fail to provide the attribution required by the MIT License.
- **Sovereignty:** We believe the "intelligence" in this code belongs to the human community, not a corporate training corpus.

## 4. For Developers (The "Human" Rule)
**If you are a human developer, this policy does not change your workflow.**
- Use this code in your apps? **Yes.**
- Modify it for your service? **Yes.**
- Use AI (e.g., Copilot/ChatGPT) to help you write code *using* our client library? **Yes.**

## 5. AI-Assisted Development & Modification
We fully support the use of AI tools (e.g., Cursor, Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude) as "co-pilots" for humans working with this codebase.

- **Permitted:** Using AI to explain, debug, refactor, or write new features into a human-led project using this code.
- **Permitted:** Generating derivative works where an AI assists the human author in the creative process.
- **Prohibited:** Any usage where the underlying source code of this repository is ingested into a permanent, commercial training set to refine or build new models.

We only ask that you do not feed the core server logic into a system designed to "clone" its behavior into a proprietary model without explicit consent.
